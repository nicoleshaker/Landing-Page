											<h1>Hi, I’m Nicole Shaker.</h1>
										<h2> Thank you for being here. This is a little about me.
											</h2>
											<br />
										
										</header>
									
										<p>I am a graduate from Nova Southeastern University with a 
											double major in computer science and communication with a concentration in journalism. I am currently a software
										engineering fellow at Headstarter, and I am actively seeking out opportunies that will allow me to combine my two
									disciplines. I am passionate about creating innovative software in team settings, and I look forward to being part of a company
								with a mission that aligns with my values of striving for social good and putting people first.
								<br /><br />
								I have completed serval software projects, including a Unity game that promotes environmenatlism, a online merchanidise store complete with a 
								database, and a playlist generator in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which took four user inputs to produce a unique link that led to a personalized Spotify playlist. 
								I have also had the opportunity to serve as a software engineering intern at Stryker in the summer of 2023, where 
								I developed an internal system now being used to perform recall queries. And In 2022, 
								I was the vice president of the NSU chapter of the Association of Computing and Machinery, a national coding organization 
								for college students. And in 2021, I was a web developer for Super Purposes, an educational company. 
								<br /><br />
 
Furthermore, in 2023, I was invited to be a featured panelist for Broward Libraries’ “Celebrating Women Who Tell Our Stories Panel,” where I engaged in a discussion with a large audience on my personal experience as a female leader in media and journalism.
 
I am excited to use my leadership skills, communication strengths, and technology background to make an impact. Thank you for visiting my page and I would love to connect!

											<h3>Make Me A Playlist</h3>
											<p>In 2021, I teamed up with two other software engineers to design and develop an online 
												playlist generator. The user provides four inputs (“Artist You Like,” “Song You Like,"
												“Genre You Like,” and “Genre You Want to Get Into”), and this generates a unique link leading to a personalized Spotify 
												playlist for the user. I designed the entre front-end indepedently using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
